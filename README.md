### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sam and I am a college student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

ðŸ”­ My passions lie in broadcast A/V technology, esports, real-time embedded systems, robotics, and IT. I also enjoy making Discord bots in my free time. I am also the Operations Director for the Pacific Esports League.

ðŸŒ± I am learning React development for fun, through the creation of my main website [samstep.net](https://samstep.net/)
