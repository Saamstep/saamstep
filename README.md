### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sam.

Hey there! My name is Sam and I am a college student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

ðŸ”­ My passions lie in broadcast A/V technology, esports, embedded systems, and IT. I also enjoy making Discord bots in my free time. I am the Operations Director for the Pacific Esports League and co-lead for a scholastic esports program at the collegiate level.

ðŸŒ± I am learning frontend development for fun, and working on more Arduino-based side projects.
